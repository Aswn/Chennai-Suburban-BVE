UBUNTU 
======
instructions to use my route in ubuntu 12.04 or later
download zip/tar.gz and extract it
copy paste following commands in the terminal (alt+ctrl+t)

sudo mv '<path to>/Chennai-Suburban-BVE/Route/Chennai' '/usr/share/games/bve/Railway/Route' 
sudo mv '<path to>/Chennai-Suburban-BVE/Object/Chennai' '/usr/share/games/bve/Railway/Object' 
if signals donot work do (most likely they will work if not)
sudo mv '<path to>/Chennai-Suburban-BVE/Object/BrSigs' '/usr/share/games/bve/Railway/Object' 

you need to be a sudo user to run these commands. 
if you are hesitant to move files into root directory you can still always run the latest openBVE 
works perfectly with mono. all you gotta do is paste the chennai and brsigs folder into 
'openbve_stable>Objects' folder (create it if it doesnt exist) and when you run it with mono 
just travel into the route folder and select the route
